The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.  Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL\\'s underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL\\'s existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.  Time Warner\\'s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts\\' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.  TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann\\'s purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.  \\n  \\n\\nTl;dr\\n'"

I could only make out the timestamp lmao. \\n\\nProject2016Energy: My screen looked like crap using \"Live Discussion\" sorting so I had to change it. My fault\\n\\nFolkFreendsine: Switch to best\\n\\nProject2016Energy: Hell yeah ima much happier now\\nTho on mobile it still locked me on Live Discussion -.-\\n\\nFolkFreendsine: Brave or chrome?\\n\\nProject2016Energy: Alien Blue Pro\\n\\nLetJSql: ALIEN BLUE FTW!\\n\\nmoan2cdeeo: What??? Alien blue was discontinued over a year ago\\n\\nexeiiakes: Reddit bought alien blue and renamed it reddit. At least mine is im on iOS idk about Android. I know they dropped support for people that paid for the app but it still works if you downloaded it when it was available.\\n\\nLetJSql: yup this, it took some digging through my account history for a download link but somewhat recently found it and am obviously not exiting out of applications because its too important \\n\\nexeiiakes: Same here\\n\\nLetJSql: Did you guys pay for the app too? I wonder if they\\'ll ever bring back pro. \\n\\nEdit: nevermind read above comment\\n\\nexeiiakes: Yeah I paid for it and it unlocked the ads and I think gave some custom features.\\n\\nLetJSql: They should have brought back premium/bonus edition... these kids need to appreciate a good piece of software god dammit \\n\\nexeiiakes: Can\\'t disagree with you more about that. It really devastated me when they stopped support without offering a solution at the time. No idea what made them do that.\\n\\nLetJSql: It was strange, did feel kinda shady considering he posted updates frequently. It honestly felt like a personal grudge against him considering how polished and great his application was before they Acquired it. \\n\\nBilly_Retin_N: Wow, who knew me asking you to switch to \\'best\\' would lead to an off-topic conversation. :p\\n\\nLetJSql: Bruh you don\\'t want to get us started on the flaws built into modern day communication systems\\n\\nBilly_Retin_N: Man, communication used to be just face-to-face conversations. Now it\\'s code on a screen, especially for those working in IT or anything tech-related, you can\\'t escape that code unless of course you\\'re outside city walls camping under .a tree somewhere lol.\\n\\nLetJSql: Or if your Elon Musk running tesla deep underground lair tunnel project\\n\\nBilly_Retin_N: Hahaha. That dude wants to develop everything, be careful, he might \"develop\" future humans with special powers or something. Everything from AI, Solar panels, tunneling deep beneath ground; bro needs to chill. \\n\\nLetJSql: We might be interfaceable with AI by late 2030s so knowing him he probably has some hyper loop vacations planned for us on Mars \\n\\nBilly_Retin_N: Damn, that would actually be pretty awesome. Hyperloop rides thru space, you know, like fucking rollercoasters. Amusement park rides taking reality to the next level.\\n\\nLetJSql: Wild shit to wrap our heads around. Knowing pace of technology right now we cant even fathom what kind of stuff will be introduced within the next decade. \\n\\nBilly_Retin_N: indeed. Let\\'s focus on good old VXWorks first then by the time Elon comes up with something new we\\'d all be like \"meh\". Whoever thought self-driving cars were gonna be the end-all-be-all for autonomous machines are yet in for a surprise. \\n\\nLetJSql: Heard John Deere farm tractors were implementing auto-drive systems sooner than some car companies which makes sense because fields/stretches of highways are way easier to optimize for automation. As for VX Works gotta wait til powershell got msft powershell Core ported to Linux at work yesterday so might start getting some C# stuff off there vs doing everything in shell++\\n\\nBilly_Retin_N: I saw this video of a driverless combine harvester, it was a JD too! Powershell sounds like exactly what id need at work but we still write compilers in Fortran.. sigh. With UNIX, Perl seems to come as default scripting language. I don\\'t even know what shell++ is nor have I heard of it, care to educate'"

The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.  Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.  Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.  TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.  \n  \n\nTl;dr\n\n\n[ASSISTANT]\nTimeWarner's quarterly profits have risen 76% to $1.13bn, largely due to increased sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advertising sales. The company also benefited from owning 8% of Google. However, its AOL division lost 464,000 subscribers in Q4, and its film division saw profits drop 27% due to box-office failures.
