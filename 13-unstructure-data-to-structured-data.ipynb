The TV couple's interest in the book world coined the term \"the Richard & Judy effect\" and created the top two best-selling paperbacks of 2004 so far. The finalists for 2005 include Andrew Taylor's The American Boy and Robbie Williams' autobiography Feel. This year's winner, Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones, sold over one million. Joseph O'Connor's Star of the Sea came second and saw sales increase by 350%. The best read award, on Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan's Channel 4 show, is part of the British Book Awards. David Mitchell's Booker-shortlisted novel, Cloud Atlas, makes it into this year's top 10 along with several lesser known works.  \"There's no doubt that this year's selection of book club entries is the best yet. If anything, the choice is even wider than last time,\" said Madeley. \"It was very hard to follow last year's extremely successful list, but we think this year's books will do even better,\" said Richard and Judy executive producer Amanda Ross. \"We were spoiled for choice and it was tough getting down to only 10 from the 301 submitted.\" ###\n"

He told US TV show 60 Minutes that Revenge of the Sith would be the darkest and most violent of the series. \"I don't think I would take a five or six-year-old to this,\" he told the CBS programme, to be aired on Sunday. Lucas predicted the film would get a US rating advising parents some scenes may be unsuitable for under-13s. It opens in the UK and US on 19 May. He said he expected the film would be classified PG-13 - roughly equivalent to a British 12A rating.  The five previous Star Wars films have all carried less restrictive PG - parental guidance - ratings in the US. In the UK, they have all been passed U - suitable for all - with the exception of Attack of The Clones, which got a PG rating in 2002. Revenge of the Sith - the third prequel to the original 1977 Star Wars film - chronicles the transformation of the heroic Anakin Skywalker into the evil Darth Vader as he travels to a Hell-like planet composed of erupting volcanoes and molten lava. \"We're going to watch him make a pact with the devil,\" Lucas said. \"The film is much more dark, more emotional. It's much more of a tragedy.\"  \n  \n\n Extract Star Wars movie series and associated ratings from the text above into a table. Every row in the table should start in a new line. \n"
