The answer is 35.\n When you were 6, your sister was half your age, so your sister was 3 years old. Now you are 70, and 70 - 6 =\n64 years have passed. So your sister is now 3 + 64 = 67 years old. The answer is 67.\n 6 years ago you were 6 and your sister was 6/2 = 3. That means your sister is now 70 - 6 + 3 = 67. The answer is 67.\n When you were 6, your sister was half your age. That means your sister was 6/2 = 3 years old.\nNow you are 70. In the same amount of time, your sister has aged from 3 to 70 as well. So your\nsister is 70 years old. The answer is 70.\n"
